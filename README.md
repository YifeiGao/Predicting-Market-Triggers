## About
Build a product that focuses on predicting market-moving events before they become widely available on news sites (such as Thomson Reuters, Associate Press) that can be utilized by Citi market traders.

## Examples of Use Cases

1. Considers social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) and other types (e.g. Global News, Stock News)
2. Uses fast and slow media types to detect macro-trends so that we can assess the impact on various portfolios
3. Groups events in a trend based on how this will affect the markets and individual asset classes
4. Builds a product that could help us evaluate potential “macro trends” and their impact on stocks

## Global News
  - User is prompted to input the name and category of the stock they want to purchase
  - An API gets the most recent news articles related to this stock
  - A classifier was trained with positive tweets and negative tweets to identify positive and negative words
  - The news articles are parsed into tokens and scanned for positive or negative connotations
  - If the majority of words relating to the stock are positive, the output recommends to buy the stock
  - If the majority of words relating to the stock are negative, the output recommends to not buy the stock

### Training Classifier
  ![](kristina_global_news/demos/train_classifier_demo.gif)

### Future Improvements
  - Currently the classifier correctly identifies positive/negative syntax
  - Further improvement could be made, however, to catch certain semantics

### Positive Examples
  - "description": "The good news is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 doesn't seem to mutate"
  - The classifier suggests to buy health stocks because the word "good" identifies this as a positive sentence
  - However, it is better to buy health stocks when coronavirus is spreading more, not less

### Negative Examples
  - "title": "Facebook Stock Is Being Hurt by Apple's Changes"
  - The classifier suggests to not buy apple stocks because the word "hurt" identifies this as a negative sentence
  - However, the negative word applies to facebook, not apple

### Demo

### Tools
  - Used NewsAPI https://newsapi.org/ because the free version allows 100 requests per day

## Twitter
  - User is prompted to input the name of the stock they want to purchase
  - An API gets the most recent 1000 tweets related to this stock
  - Used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media
  - Cleaned tokens, trained model and performed semantic analysis
  - VADER provides a compound score, it is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1(most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).
    positive sentiment : (compound score >= 0.05)
    neutral sentiment : (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)
    negative sentiment : (compound score <= -0.05)
  - The tweets are parsed into tokens and scanned for positive or negative connotations
  - If the majority of words relating to the stock are positive, the output recommends to buy the stock
  - If the majority of words relating to the stock are negative, the output recommends to not buy the stock

### Testing Classifier
  ![](https://github.com/Kristina-hub/Predicting-Market-Triggers/blob/main/sadaf_twitter/demos/testing_classifier.gif)
  
### Positive Examples
  - "description": "Apple is being treated as the biggest ATM in the world Berkshire Hathaway's best decision last decade could bite"
  - The classifier suggests to buy stocks because the word "biggest" and "best" identifies this as a positive sentence

### Negative Examples
  - "title": "#DowJones down nearly 400 points as stocks sell off hard, but #GameStop soars again #stocks #investingâ€¦ https://t.co/j2LcFgbuV9""
  - The classifier suggests to not buy apple stocks because the word "down" and "hard" identifies this as a negative sentence

### Demo
  ![](https://github.com/Kristina-hub/Predicting-Market-Triggers/blob/main/sadaf_twitter/demos/twitter_market_prediction_demo.gif)
  
### Tools
  - Used tweepy API wrapper https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/api.html
  
## Facebook
  - Used a facebook scraper to collect posts data from public stock related groups
  - Combining Sklearn and NLTK classifieres to imporve the accuracy
  - Classifieres were trained with short movie reviews to identify positive and negative words
  - The trained classifiers are saved as ['\*.pickle'] files under [yifei_facebook/algo_pickle] folder
  - The data collected from facebook are parsed into cleaned tokens and performed senmantic analysis

## Reddit
  - Used praw API wrapper https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ to get the newest comment in the subreddit which is related to the input stock
  - Combining Sklearn and NLTK classifieres to imporve the accuracy
  - Classifieres were trained with short movie reviews to identify positive and negative words
  - The trained classifiers are saved as ['\*.pickle'] files under [yifei_reddit/algo_pickle] folder
  - The data collected from reddit are parsed into cleaned tokens and performed senmantic analysis

## Integration
  - Each market trigger (Global/Stock News, Facebook, Twitter) returns 1 (buy) or 0 (don't buy)
  - The recommendation given (ex. 75% likely to be a good investment) is an average of all market triggers
  - Abstraction allows us to easily add more new market triggers in the future
